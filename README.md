# COVID-19 Risk Estimation for L.A. County using a Bayesian Time-varying SIR-model

This repository presents a rigorous hybrid model-and-data-driven Bayesian approach to risk scoring that yields a simplified color-coded risk level for each community. The risk score corresponds to the probability of someone currently healthy getting infected with COVID-19 in the near future. 

## Data Source

This project used CoVID-19 case data from LA County Dep. of Public Health, which is also available in the following repository: [Data](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/lacounty_covid19_data/).
